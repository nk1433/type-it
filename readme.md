# Project Name

	Project description.

## Keys

* A short list of things to understand the package, better.

## Notes

* Though pnpm is the preferred package manager, package-lock is still kept to widen support.

## Usage
## Setup - Linux / Mac
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/Laufire/react-starter.git project-name
$ cd project-name
$ sh ./adopt.sh
$ sh ./setup.sh
```

## Setup - Windows
```sh
C:\> git clone https://github.com/Laufire/react-starter.git project-name
C:\> cd project-name
C:\> .\adopt.bat
```

## Starting the App
```sh
$ pnpm i
$ pnpm start
```

## ToDo

* Have branches to allow for multiple templates.
	* One for a clean one to start new projects.
	* One with basic examples.

* Audit the packages. It's not done, yet. Due to poor understanding of the dependencies.
